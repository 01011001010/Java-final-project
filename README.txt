Popis:
3D plot visualization tool created according to specification.

The plot is composed of spheres coloured based on their relative value.
The viewed interval can be chosen with sliders, as well as the zoom of the
z-axis and the resolution (length of intervals between x/y values plotted).

The application is also able to display point-clouds from .xyz files, though
the files should be normalised to include values from the interval <-1, 1>
to be displayed properly;

There are provided multiple example functions and point-clouds available
with the simple push of a button.

Further personalization is available in the options to choose colours used to
highlight the values, as colour is a preattentive feature and quite important
for human perception.
